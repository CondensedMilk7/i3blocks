# My i3blocks Configuration
![i3blocks-custom](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/82287873/141141343-11f4483c-c065-4cfe-9865-f3690c6b7e05.png)

## Dependencies
* fonts-font-awesome (or ttf-font-awesome on Arch)
* acpi
* python3
* mpstat
* kbdd (for keyboard layout)

## Features
This is just a simple configuration of i3blocks with scripts taken from 
[i3blocks-contrib](https://github.com/vivien/i3blocks-contrib). Each block will look
for the script file with the same name in ~/.config/i3blocks/scripts/ directory. 
Some blocks are commented out either because they don't work (yet) or because I
don't need them right now.

I added a custom message prompt in the corner just to remember what's important
and to keep vigilance. Add your own message (or whatever you want) in
i3blocks/scripts/custom_prompt
